[![Anti-Mine](https://i.imgur.com/ExgcYpu.png "Anti Mine")](https://i.imgur.com/ExgcYpu.png "Anti Mine")

A Minesweeper inspired puzzle game.

AntiMine aims to bring the deductive reasoning, pattern recognition, and satisfaction of uncovering tiles from vanilla minesweeper into a whole new and more intuitive experience. Its called AntiMine because it breaks away from the rigidity of minesweeper. You dont have to be perfect to win a game of AntiMine. Mines and anti mines that are harder to locate deal less damage to the player.
